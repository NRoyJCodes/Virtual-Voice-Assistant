# Virtual-Voice-Assistant
A Virtual Voice Assistant is a piece of software that communicates with users via voice commands using **text-to-speech**, natural language processing (NLP), and speech recognition. With the help of the project, users may carry out operations including information searches, reminders, application control, query answering, and system command execution without using their hands. In order to deliver a seamless, human-like conversational experience, it listens to user input, comprehends intent, processes the request, and reacts with pertinent actions or spoken output.
